# Insp3ct0r WriteUp

With the title of the challenge it gives us a hint where we need to look for the flag, inspecting the web page. When looking on main webpage there is part 1 of the flag.</br>

</br>

Digging around the source page for other file, I stumbled upon mjjs.js which has part 3 of the flag.</br>

</br>

Then finally the last part of the flag is located in mycss.css, at the very bottom.</br>

</br>

Putting them all together the flag is picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2e7b23e3}.</br>
