# crackme-py

Downloading the python file and opening it up. I immediately see two functions but only one is being used.</br>

</br>

The first function "decode_secret" is not being used but is mostly the function we need to used to decode the "bezos_cc_secret".</br>
With that I copied the secret key, alphabet, and function to and ran it producing the flag.</br>
