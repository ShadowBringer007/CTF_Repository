This challenge has us connecting to an external website which looks like a simple website input a cookie and get information back.</br>

</br>

Doing our due diligence, we check the robots.txt which this site does not have one and check the cookies. Looking at the cookies section there is a key pair. With snickerdoodle the values is 1 but is we go back to the home page the value changes to -1.</br>

</br>

With this knowledge, I did one more test to determine the value changes the cookies type with 5. We got a peanut butter cookie.</br>

</br>

Now I wrote up a small python script to make a request to the website with a different cookies values. Then checking the response for the flag.</br>
