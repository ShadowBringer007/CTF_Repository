But the title of the challenge gives the hint of what needs to be done as "GET" and "HEAD" are in full caps. If one does a quick lookup these are both http requests methods. The tool I will using for this challenge is the Burp Suite Community Edition.</br>
I started the proxy tools to capture a web request and this will place the site in the Target tab.</br>

</br>
From the Target tab, I will send of the request to the Repeater tab to allow me to continously manipulate the request.</br>

</br>
From the Repeater tab, I will manipulate the request and place a "HEAD" request instead of the "GET" request. Sending this request, will get the Response containing the flag.</br>
