But the title of the challenge gives the hint of what needs to be done as "GET" and "HEAD" are in full caps. If one does a quick lookup these are both http requests methods. The tool I will using for this challenge is the Burp Suite Community Edition.</br>
I started the proxy tools to capture a web request and this will place the site in the Target tab.</br>
