# Matryoshka doll WriteUp

When downloading the file, we get a picture of a russian nesting doll. Since we are in the forensic category I am going to run binwalk on the picture.</br>
When using the "-e" argument, binwalk will extract file of know file types.

</br>
</br>

After extraction, and heading into the base_images directory there is another image there. With this new image I a, gonna run binwalk again.</br>
