When reading the challenge, it gives the source code to look for the vulnerability. As well as a port to connect to a server.</br>
First, looking at the server we are presented with 2 options, to Buy or View.</br>

When checking out the 2 options Buy presents a user input while View gives no input.</br>

Now looking at the source code for some sort of function for buying stocks as it has a user input and something we can manipulate. The source code has a "buy_stocks" function to as a target.</br>

In the function, the flag seems to be loaded into the memory stack and theres a printf() function which has a string format vulnerabilities.</br>
