# Super SSH

Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important.</br>
Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 59976 to get the flag?</br>
You'll also need the password 1ad5be0d. If asked, accept the fingerprint with yes.</br>
If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: https://webshell.picoctf.org</br>
If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell</br>

This above may change as the challenge creates a instance for each user.
