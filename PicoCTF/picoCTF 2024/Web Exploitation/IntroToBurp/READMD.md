Routing to the website it looks like a simple login page. When putting "credentials" in and hitting the register button it takes us to a 2fa page. </br>

Looking at the 2fa page and putting an input. The intercept of the page doesn't look like it does much but I am going to send the request to the Repeater tab in Burp.</br>

Looking at the second hint "Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.". One way we can do this is just removing POST variables. In this case we can remove the "otp" variable. In doing so the flag is revealed.</br>
