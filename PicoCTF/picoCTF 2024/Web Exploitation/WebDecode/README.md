# WebDecode WriteUp

When opening the webpage it is just taunting us about not being able to find the flag. But the first thing to check for is the robots.txt to make sure there are no web pages hiding from us.</br>

</br>

With no robots.txt file, its time to inspect the web page to find anything that's hidden or odd. Checking out the main page, nothing seems off.</br>

</br>

Now heading to about web page, we have a different prompt which is signaling us that there is something here possibly.</br>

</br>

Inspecting the page, immediately a long string of characters sticks out.</br>

</br>

Taking the string and pasting it in cyberchef using the base64 decode. We get the flag.</br>
