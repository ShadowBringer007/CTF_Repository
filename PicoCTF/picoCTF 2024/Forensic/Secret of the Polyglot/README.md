Downloading the file has a pdf extension when opening it up it shows the end part of the flag.</br>

This is pretty odd, uploading the flag to cyberchef to examine the magic bytes, it shows a png file header.</br>

I am using a windows machine during this challenge and Windows will open files based on the its extension. With this in mind, changing the extension to a png should display the other part of the flag.</br>
And it does show the first part of the flag.</br>
