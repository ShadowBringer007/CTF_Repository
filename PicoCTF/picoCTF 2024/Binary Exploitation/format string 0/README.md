# format string 0 WriteUp

When getting the flag for this challenge there  are two solutions. One is most likely the intended solution and another which is not the intended solution.</br>
</br>
The first solution I will show is the unintended solution. Looking at the source code which is given by the challenge, I see that the buffer is given a certain size (32). Knowing this I looked in the code for the first prompt to see where user inputs are taken.</br>

Knowing this I am going to fill the entire buffer with over 32 characters to generate an error as the scanf() function does not have an bounds protection.</br>

When submitting we will cause a segmentation fault and the flag is produced.</br>

The proper way to do this challenge is to take the hint from the challenge name. I first look for any string formats. On the first prompt in "Gr%114d_Cheese", there is %11 with will cause errors that'll allow us to move to the next prompt.</br>

</br>

In the next prompt we have "Cla%sic_Che%s%steak" the %s are string formats which will pop arrays of strings from the stack when using printf.</br>

When submitting this prompt the flag is shown.</br>
