# Magikarp Ground Mission WriteUp

For this challenge we need to connect to a instance via ssh with the username ctf-player and password abcba9f7.</br>
Once we connect to the instance, our first instruction from the description was to use the "ls" command.</br>

After doing that I followed the instuctions on the instance to get the entire flag.</br>
