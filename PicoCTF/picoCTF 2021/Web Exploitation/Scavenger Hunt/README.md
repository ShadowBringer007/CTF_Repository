# Scavenger Hunt WriteUp

We are given a website to take a look at and with the little of the challenge it seems like there will be parts to the flag. Inspecting the main page and there seems to be Part 1 of the flag.</br>

</br>

Next I looked at the Sources tab to see if I can find more. myjs.js has a hint at the bottom which I think points to robots.txt as that stops web crawlers from indexing a website.</br>

</br>

Following that hint, I went to robots.txt and found Part 3 of the flag.</br>

</br>

Going back to the sources tab, I still needed to check out mycss.css. Looking at the bottom of the file there Part 2 of the flag.</br>

</br>

With that going back to robots.txt there seems to be another hint. Hinting at another file which Apache servers have. After doing some research on the Apache site (https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/configuring.html) there is a .htaccess file. Testing if that works, I get Part 4 of the flag.</br>

</br>

Taking a look at the final hint, it has something to do with Mac and storing information. Doing some research there is a file on Mac computers called a .DS_Store file. With testing it we are given the final part of the flag.</br>
