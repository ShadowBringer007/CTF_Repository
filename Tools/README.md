# Tools

This folder will contain tools that I use in different categories for CTF challenges. There will be a link to each tool and the notes I have learned about each tool. Tools will include binaries and online tools.
The struture of the tool list will be broken down into the categories. Each category will have a list at the top of the document with hyperlinks to each tool. Each tool will have a link to the documentation or sources where I learned how to use the tool.
